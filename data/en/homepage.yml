about:
  content: |
    Infrastructure and security engineer with over 20 years of experience in critical environments.
    Self-taught, curious, passionate about open source and self-hosting. I acquired my expertise through self-learning,
    listening to experts, and constant hands-on experience deploying resilient applications.

    Specialized in Linux, cloud, CI/CD, security, and observability, I can operate at all levels of modern infrastructure.
    I work closely with developers and business teams, with a product-oriented mindset.

    I have strong experience in highly regulated domains: finance, personal data, PCI-DSS audits.
    My approach focuses on automation, collective understanding, and transparency.
