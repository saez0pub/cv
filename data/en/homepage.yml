about:
  content: |
    Infrastructure and security engineer with more than twenty years of experience in critical environments. 
    Specialized in SRE, Devops and Devsecops, I improve platform reliability, security and performance through 
    automation, observability and modern cloud architectures.

    I have worked across organizations of all sizes, including startups, scale ups, SMBs and large enterprises, 
    which has enabled me to adapt my practices to diverse levels of maturity and constraints.

    Expert in Linux, cloud, CI CD, security and observability, I operate across the entire production lifecycle. 
    My strong interest in software development (Typescript, Effect.ts, Python, Bash) helps me industrialize 
    environments and improve system reliability in depth.

    I am seeking an SRE, Devops or Devsecops role within teams aiming to enhance the quality, security and 
    resilience of their platforms.

    My background includes highly regulated sectors such as finance, personal data protection and PCI DSS audits. 
    I value automation, collective understanding and transparency.
