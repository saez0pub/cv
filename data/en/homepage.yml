about:
  content: |
    Infrastructure and security engineer with more than 20 years of experience in critical environments.
    Self-taught, curious and passionate about open source and self-hosting, I built my expertise through continuous learning,
    knowledge sharing with experts and hands-on work delivering resilient applications to production.
    
    I have worked within organizations of all sizes, from startups to large enterprises, including scale-ups and SMEs,
    which has allowed me to adapt my practices to diverse contexts, maturity levels and constraints.

    Specialized in Linux, cloud, CI/CD, security and observability, I am able to intervene across all layers of a modern
    infrastructure. I work closely with developers and product teams with a strong product-oriented mindset. I also have a
    strong interest in software development, with regular practice in Typescript, Effect.ts, Python and Bash, used to automate,
    industrialize and improve system reliability.
    
    I am seeking a position as SRE, DevOps or DevSecOps within teams looking to strengthen the reliability,
    security and overall quality of their platforms.

    I have solid experience in highly regulated sectors such as finance, personal data protection and PCI-DSS audits.
    My approach emphasizes automation, shared understanding and transparency.
